# playlist-builder

A helpful tool to reorder your playlists optimally!

Currently the files consist of a helper file (spotipy_test.py) that you can use to pull information from your profile via spotify. This file contains some functions to aid in making queries and also for plotting the data for visual inspection.

There is also a Juptyer Notebook that contains an example of how to pull and save the data for further use. This will be updated with more information later.

The goal of this project is to optimally order your playlist according to certain metrics.
