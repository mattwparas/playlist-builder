# playlist-builder

A helpful tool to aid in reordering your Spotify playlists!

## What is playlist-builder?

Have you ever had to put together a playlist for a party? Or maybe for getting amped up? Did you ever feel like the shuffle from Spotify let you down? That you had to skip one too many songs because it didn't fit the mood you wanted at that very moment?

That's where playlist-builder comes in.

Spotify has all sorts of calculated metrics for songs, including 'energy', 'danceability', or 'valence'. Using these metrics, playlist-builder lets you take a playlist, and define a custom function for the flow of your playlist. No more relying on Spotify to shuffle and randomly pick what you want- playlist-builder will reorder the songs in your playlist to best fit the given function.

Essentially, you can define the flow of your night.

demographics.py includes plotting functions that let you understand the demographics of the playlist that you are working with.
